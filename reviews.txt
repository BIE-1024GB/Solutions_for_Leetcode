Default constructor in Java initializes member data variable to default values (numeric values are initialized as 0, booleans are initialized as false and references are initialized as null).

Unlike C++, static local variables are not allowed in Java.

Java garbage collection(mark and sweep):
  When an object is created, it's marked 'false'
    Mark: search from a root(can be DFS) for reachable objects, which are then marked 'true'
    Sweep: go through the heap, discard objects marked 'false'(unreachable), mark others to 'false'
  Advantages: simple, complete
  Disadvantages: application threads need to be paused for it

Java serialization:
    In Java, serialization refers to the process of converting an object's state into a byte stream, which can then be
    saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database. This byte stream can later be deserialized to recreate
    the original object. Serialization is a mechanism that allows objects to be persisted and transferred between
    different environments, enabling features like remote method invocation (RMI), object persistence, and distributed
    computing.
